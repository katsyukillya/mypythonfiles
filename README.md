- The "**Directory_and_File_Tree**" creates a file tree-like structure indicating each sub-directory and file inside the directory.
- The "**Lottery**" generates the lottery numbers for _Power Ball_ and/or for _Mega Millions_ plays. 

  Besides generating the on-demand numbers, the program also asks the user if s/he wants to send an email with those generated numbers. 
  If the user selects to send and email, s/he will have to provide the sender's email address and password as well as the recipient(s) email address(es).
